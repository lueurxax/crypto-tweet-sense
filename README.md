CryptoTweetSense

Discover the pulse of the cryptocurrency market with CryptoTweetSense â€“ your intelligent tool for surfacing the most popular crypto conversations on Twitter and engaging with them directly from Telegram.

Project Overview

CryptoTweetSense is a cutting-edge application designed to bridge the gap between social media buzz and crypto enthusiasts. This tool empowers users to sift through the noise of Twitter to find and share the most relevant and trending crypto-related tweets. By integrating with Telegram, it not only simplifies the process of content dissemination but also involves the community in content curation through a democratic voting feature.

Seamless Telegram Integration: Automatically posts selected tweets to a designated Telegram channel, making it easy for users to stay updated on trending discussions.
Community-Driven Curation: Incorporates a simple like/dislike voting mechanism within the Telegram channel, allowing users to express their interest or disinterest in the shared content.
Dynamic Content Ranking: Modifies the tweet selection algorithm based on user feedback, learning over time to improve the relevance of shared tweets.
Analytics Dashboard: Provides insights into the most liked/disliked content, user engagement, and tweet trends to guide future content curation.
